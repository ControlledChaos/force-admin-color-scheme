# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* When using the constant, disable the profile checkbox added by this plugin. For admin users, provide a notice somewhere (in lieu of the color scheme picker?) that indicates the constant is in use to force a given scheme.
* Validate the color scheme that is configured (in the event a color scheme is no longer available, ignore it and show notice to admin user).
* Record and report (to other admins) the name (and possibly datetime) of the user who forced the admin color scheme.

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/force-admin-color-scheme/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/force-admin-color-scheme/) as an issue or PR).
